    * The PR has been reviewed by Quadrivium and is ready for review by Parity
    
#### Archive storage
* Main PR https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10029/ is ready codewise and has been reviewed by Quadrivium member
    * We will update PR description and request review from Parity
* Related PR https://github.com/paritytech/parity-common/pull/951 is ready for Parity review

#### Shadow integration.

* https://github.com/paritytech/parity-common/pull/950 has been merged
* https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10055 has been reviewed by Quadrivium and is being reviewed by Parity's someone-unknown

#### Multi-slot collation

* [PR 10022](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10022) has been reviewed by Quadrivium and Parity (Sebastian)
    * Main comment is regarding approach that we chose (simple slot increment)
    * As suggested by Sebastian we are reworking PR completely to calculate slot numbers as simple division of current time by slot duration, without panicking after runtime upgrade

* PR to erasure coding repo with optimizations: https://github.com/paritytech/erasure-coding/pull/16
    * Conducted review by our team member
    * Need to decide whether to keep parallel execution or not
* PR with the new Erasure coding to polkadot-sdk: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10116
