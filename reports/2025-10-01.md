# Report - 01-10-2025

* **Period:** 17092025 - 01102025
* **Previous report:** https://github.com/qdrvm/polkadot-sdk-reports/blob/master/reports/2025-09-17.md
* **Treasury grant scope**: Ref. 1689: Polkadot-SDK improvements proposal 1

### Main highlights:

#### State sync:
* Had a call with Sebastian and Basti to resolve state sync blockers. Topics discussed:
    * Storing nodes directly vs. decoding them into KV pairs first
    * Order of storing the nodes into the DB (for resume)
* To proceed we agreed to:
    * First PR will only focus on fixing the immediate problem with OOM
    * Later we will address optimizations concerns like node ordering
* Today's status:
    * PR + testing this week
    

#### Archive storage
* Storing via key + block number was implemented and works in parallel with merkle trie state
* Querying historical data is WIP:
    * RocksDB has iterators that can be used for example to seek lower/upper bound. We use them to efficiently find by block number containing most recent state changes
    * In Polkadot-SDK RocksDB is hidden very deep, team is updating crates & traits to unlock usage of additional operations (e.g. lower/upper bound seek)

#### Shadow integration.
* Enabling prepare/execute workers to work under Shadow:
  * ICP was done via unix sockets calls which are not supported by Shadow
  * Unix socket calls were replaced by TCP:
      * After update everything works natively without Shadow
      * Does not work with Shadow:
          * Workers launch
          * mathcing of versions works
          * reading of data from host is not successful
  * Currently team is troubleshooting workers with TCP

#### Multi-slot collation
* During the call Basti suggested implementation of simple slot increment:
    * we simply take previous slot number and increase it by the number of slot durations elapsed since the last block
    * we need somehow to store the previous value
      * implementing by obtaining previous slot number from the latest block

#### Faster erasure-coding (RFC-139)
* On pause until multi-slot collation is implemented
