* **Previous report:** https://github.com/qdrvm/polkadot-sdk-reports/blob/master/reports/2025-10-15.md
* **Treasury grant scope**: Ref. 1689: Polkadot-SDK improvements proposal 1

### Main highlights:

#### State sync:
* [PR 9247](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9247) is ready, but still no final review (who we should request?)
     
#### State sync v3:
* Ready code-wise in the [branch](https://github.com/turuslan/polkadot-sdk/tree/state-sync-proposal)
    * Tested on PASEO
    
#### Archive storage
* Introduced necessary fixes for child storage
* Introduced prefix collision workaround
* Remaining steps
    * Introduce keys iteration within one state
    * Measure storage growth with new database schema
    * Workaround for merkle root calculation (if we will need historical blocks execution)

#### Shadow integration.
* Managed to simulate network with 3MB parachain blocks via remark transactions
* Working on configuring glutton-parachain
* On-going PR introducing changes required for shadow compatibility https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10055

#### Multi-slot collation

* Opened [PR 10022](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10022) with simple increment
* Next steps:
    * test increased slots under shadow with collator isolation

#### Faster erasure-coding (RFC-139)
* Opened PR to erasure coding repo with optimizations: https://github.com/paritytech/erasure-coding/pull/16
* Opened PR with the new Erasure coding to polkadot-sdk: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10116
