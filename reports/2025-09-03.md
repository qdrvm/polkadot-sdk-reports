* **Period:** 21082025 - 03092025
* **Previous report:** https://github.com/qdrvm/polkadot-sdk-reports/blob/master/reports/2025-08-20.md
* **Treasury grant**: Ref. 1689: Polkadot-SDK improvements proposal 1

### Main highlights:

* Ref 1689:
  * The proposal has been approved!
* State sync:
  * Issue is reproduced during Astar collator synchronization using the flags:
```sh
astar-collator \
  --state-pruning 1000 \
  --blocks-pruning 1000 \
  --name aster-1 \
  --chain astar \
  --base-path astar-node-1 \
  -- \
  --sync warp
```
  * Node crashes during sync of Polkadot's state when running on 4GB RAM instance
  * On the fixes PR, synchronization gets stuck, currently fixing
* Shadow integration.
  * After disabling Jemalloc, secure validator mode, and adding x-shadow feature single node execution under shadow became stable:
    * Single node network has been successfully tested: 2 hours of simulated time was executed in 2.5 minutes of real time
  * Starting tests with simple zombienet tests
  * Ongoing PRs:
    * Disabling Jemalloc: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9472
* Compact archive node
  * Refactoring of state storage is WIP
* Faster erasure-coding (RFC-139)
  * Deprioritized in favor of multi-slot collation
* Multi-slot collation
  * Starting RFC implementation
