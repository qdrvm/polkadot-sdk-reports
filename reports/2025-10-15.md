# Report - 15-10-2025

* **Period:** 01102025 - 15102025
* **Previous report:** https://github.com/qdrvm/polkadot-sdk-reports/blob/master/reports/2025-10-01.md
* **Treasury grant scope**: Ref. 1689: Polkadot-SDK improvements proposal 1

### Main highlights:

#### State sync:
* [PR 9247](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9247) was updated to reflect changes requested after the meeting with Basti and Sebastian
    * Removed key insertion order
    * Kept only state import interface required to fix RAM issue
    * Waiting Basti's reply/review
* Opened [PR 227](https://github.com/paritytech/trie/pull/227) to trie repo fixing the bug decoding compact proof in prefix-db
    * Basti [endorsed](https://github.com/paritytech/trie/pull/227#discussion_r2428203574) the changes, but no approve yet
        * who else should be added to review?
     
#### State sync v3:
* Getting started
    
#### Archive storage
* Implemented key + block number storage schema
    * in parity-common repo added interface for iterating in rocksb rows
    * in polkadot-sdk updated traits for database to introduce usage of this iterator
    * in archive storage implemented usage of this iterators (upper bound/lower bound operations)
* Troubleshooting historical queries with in-memory database
    * Adding unit test with querying historical data
* Next steps
    * Once historical queries work we proceed with child storage fixes
    * Introduce keys iteration within one state
    * Measure storage growth with new database schema
    * Prefix collision workaround
    * Workaround for merkle root calculation (if we will need historical blocks execution)

#### Shadow integration.
* Finished fixing workers
* Relaychain and parachain nodes are running, finalization works
* Tested collator isolation
    * So far isolated collator is able to create parachain blocks
* Next steps
    * investigate increasing network size and POV size
    * finalize all changes to Polkadot-SDK and prepare PR

#### Multi-slot collation

* Branch with fixed formula, it is checked and works under zombietests
* Opened [PR 10022](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10022) with simple increment
    * take previous value and increase it
    * slot number is obtained from the last block
* Opened [PR 10023](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10023) with removed panic
    * PR is already closed by Basti :)
* Next steps:
    * need review for simple increment
    * test increased slots under shadow with collator isolation

#### Faster erasure-coding (RFC-139)
* Fixed memory management in few places
* Fixing merklization
